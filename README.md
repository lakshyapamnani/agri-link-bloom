🌾 AgriLink

AgriLink is a web-based platform that connects local farmers directly with consumers, enabling the delivery of fresh, affordable, and chemical-free produce from farm to doorstep.

🚀 Why AgriLink?

The gap between farmers and end consumers is filled with middlemen, driving up prices for consumers while reducing profit margins for farmers. AgriLink empowers both parties:

👨‍🌾 Farmers get fair pricing and visibility.

🏡 Consumers get fresh farm produce straight to their homes.
